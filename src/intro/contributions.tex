\section{Contributions}
\label{intro:sec:contributions}

In this section, we summarize the following original major contributions in
this thesis:
\begin{itemize}

    \item a new expression-based intermediate representation, metasemantic
    intermediate representation, developed based on the formal semantics of
    programs, to safely and considerably reduce the size of the search space of
    equivalent programs~\cite{soap2};

    \item an efficient algorithm to discover equivalent expressions and MIRs
    through bottom-up hierarchy, graph partitioning, and intelligent pruning of
    optimization candidates by performing accuracy, area estimation and latency
    analysis~\cite{soap};

    \item for the first time we bring together standard program equivalences
    that do not affect program behavior (\eg~loop/branch splitting/merging,
    partial loop unrolling, rules that removes extraneous array accesses), and
    non-standard transformation rules (\eg~arithmetic rules), to be used in a
    novel way to significantly impact latency, resource usage and accuracy of a
    numerical program~\cite{soap3};

    \item an accuracy analysis based on abstract interpretation to calculate
    bounds on the output and their corresponding round-off errors of a given
    optimized expression~\cite{soap} or program candidate~\cite{soap2};

    \item a scheduling analysis that estimates the latency and resource usage
    of a given optimized candidate~\cite{soap3}; and

    \item incorporating the above-mentioned techniques, the first optimizer to
    \emph{automatically} and \emph{safely} to produce optimized programs (and
    subsequent RTL implementations with Vivado HLS) on the three-dimensional
    Pareto frontier of options that trade off run time, accuracy, and
    area~\cite{soap3}.

\end{itemize}
