This thesis introduces a new technique, and its associated tool \soap, to
automatically perform source-to-source optimization of numerical programs,
specifically targeting the trade-off among numerical accuracy, latency, and
resource usage as a \acrlong{hls} flow for \acrshort{fpga} implementations.  A
new intermediate representation, \acrshort{mir}, is introduced to carry out
the abstraction and optimization of numerical programs.  Equivalent structures
in \acrshortpl{mir} are efficiently discovered using methods based on formal
semantics by taking into account axiomatic rules from real arithmetic, such as
associativity, distributivity and others, in tandem with program equivalence
rules that enable control-flow restructuring and eliminate redundant array
accesses.  For the first time, we bring rigorous approaches from software
static analysis, specifically formal semantics and \acrlong{ai}, to bear
on program transformation for \acrlong{hls}.  New abstract semantics are
developed to generate a computable subset of equivalent \acrshortpl{mir}
from an original \acrshort{mir}.  Using formal semantics, three objectives
are calculated for each \acrshort{mir} representing a pipelined numerical
program: the accuracy of computation and an estimate of resource utilization
in \acrshort{fpga} and the latency of program execution.  The optimization of
these objectives produces a Pareto frontier consisting of a set of equivalent
\acrshortpl{mir}.  We thus go beyond existing literature by not only optimizing
the precision requirements of an implementation, but changing the structure
of the implementation itself.  Using \soap{} to optimize the structure of a
variety of real world and artificially generated arithmetic expressions in
single precision, we improve either their accuracy or the resource utilization
by up to 60\%.  When applied to a suite of computational intensive numerical
programs from PolyBench and Livermore Loops benchmarks, \soap{} has generated
circuits that enjoy up to a 12$\times$ speedup, with a simultaneous 7$\times$
increase in accuracy, at a cost of up to 4$\times$ more \acrshortpl{lut}.
