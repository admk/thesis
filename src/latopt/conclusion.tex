\section{Summary}
\label{lo:sec:conclusion}

Minimizing the latency of loops is a central task for \gls{hls} tools that
obtain \gls{fpga} implementations from numerical C programs.  Loop latency can
often be reduced by performing simple rewrites to minimize inter-iteration
data-dependences, but \gls{hls} tools cannot enable such rewrites by default
because they may impact the accuracy of floating-point computations.  This
chapter presents the first tool that is able to automatically rewrite a given
program to optimize latency, while controlling for accuracy and resource usage.
Our experimental results suggest that, in fact, latency and accuracy are often
\emph{not} in conflict: that programs aggressively optimized for latency can
also have minimal round-off errors, albeit with greater resource usage.  We
have demonstrated that \soap~can optimize commonly used code fragments from
PolyBench~\cite{polybench} and Livermore Loops~\cite{livermore} to have up to a
$12\times$ increase in performance, and up to $7\times$ reduction of round-off
errors, at the cost of up to $4\times$ more resource utilization.
