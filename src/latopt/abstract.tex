Loops are pervasive in numerical programs, so state-of-the-art high-level
synthesis (HLS) tools use pipelining to schedule them efficiently. Still, the
run time performance of the resultant FPGA implementation is limited by data
dependences between loop iterations. Some of these dependence constraints can
be alleviated by rewriting the program according to arithmetic identities
(\eg~associativity and distributivity), memory access reductions, and control
flow optimizations (\eg~partial loop unrolling). HLS tools cannot safely enable
such rewrites by default because they may spoil the accuracy of floating-point
computations and increase area usage. In this paper, we introduce the first
open-source program optimizer for automatically rewriting a given program to
optimize latency while controlling for accuracy and area. Our tool reports a
three-dimensional Pareto frontier that the programmer can use to resolve the
trade-off according to their needs. When applied to a suite of PolyBench and
Livermore Loops benchmarks, our tool has generated programs that enjoy up to a
12$\times$ speedup, with a simultaneous 7$\times$ increase in accuracy, at a
cost of up to 4$\times$ more LUTs.
