\begin{abstract}
    This paper introduces SOAP, a new tool to automatically optimize the
structure of arithmetic expressions for FPGA implementation as part of a
high level synthesis flow, taking into account axiomatic rules derived
from real arithmetic, such as distributivity, associativity and others. We
explicitly target an optimized area/accuracy trade-off, allowing arithmetic
expressions to be automatically re-written for this purpose. For the first
time, we bring rigorous approaches from software static analysis, specifically
formal semantics and abstract interpretation, to bear on source-to-source
transformation for high-level synthesis. New abstract semantics are developed
to generate a computable subset of equivalent expressions from an original
expression. Using formal semantics, we calculate two objectives, the accuracy
of computation and an estimate of resource utilization in FPGA\@. The
optimization of these objectives produces a Pareto frontier consisting of a
set of expressions. This gives the synthesis tool the flexibility to choose
an implementation satisfying constraints on both accuracy and resource
usage. We thus go beyond existing literature by not only optimizing the
precision requirements of an implementation, but changing the structure of the
implementation itself. Using our tool to optimize the structure of a variety of
real world and artificially generated examples in single precision, we improve
either their accuracy or the resource utilization by up to 60\%.
