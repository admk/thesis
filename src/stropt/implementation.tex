\section{Implementation}
\label{so:sec:implementation}

The majority of our tool, SOAP, is implemented in Python. For computing
errors in real arithmetic, we use exact arithmetic based on rational numbers
within the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)~\cite{gmp}. We
also use the multi-precision floating-point library MPFR~\cite{mpfr} for
access to floating-point rounding modes and arbitrary precision floating-point
computation.

Because of the workload of equivalent expression finding, the underlying
algorithm is optimized in many ways. First, for each iteration, the relation
finding function $\eqstep_k$ is only applied to newly discovered expressions
in the previous iteration. Secondly, results of functions such as $\eqstep_k$,
$\area$ and $\error$ are cached, since there is a large chance that these
results from subexpressions are reused several times, subexpressions are also
maximally shared to eliminate duplication in memory. Thirdly, the computation
of $\eqstep_k$ is fully multithreaded.

The resource statistics of operators are provided using FloPoCo~\cite{flopoco}
and Xilinx Synthesis Technology (XST)~\cite{xst}. Initially, For each
combination of an operator, an exponent width between 5 and 16, and a mantissa
width ranging from 10 to 113, 2496 distinct implementations are generated
using FloPoCo. All of them are optimized to use DSP blocks. They are then
synthesized using XST, targeting a Virtex-6 FPGA device (XC6VLX760). Because
LUTs are generally more contrained resources than DSP blocks in floating-point
computations, we provide synthesis statistics in LUTs only.
