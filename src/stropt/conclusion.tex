\section{Summary}
\label{so:sec:conclusion}

We provide a formal approach to the optimization of arithmetic expressions
for both accuracy and resource usage in high-level synthesis.  The method
proposed in this chapter and the associated tool, \soap, encompass three kind
of semantics that describe the accumulated roundoff errors, count operators in
expressions considering common subexpression elimination, and derive equivalent
expressions.  For a set of input expressions, the proposed approach works out
the respective sets of equivalent expressions in a hierarchical bottom-up
fashion, with a windowing depth limit and Pareto selection to help reduce the
complexity of equivalent expression discovery.  Using \soap, we improve either
the accuracy of our sample expressions or the resource utilization by up to
60\%, over the originals under single precision. \soap~enables a high-level
synthesis tool to optimize the structure as well as the precision of arithmetic
expressions, then to automatically choose an implementation that satisfies
accuracy and resource usage constraints.

Because we underpin our approach in formal semantics, it provides the
necessary foundation which permits us to extend the method for general
numerical program transformation in high-level synthesis.  Therefore in
Chapter~\ref{chp:progopt}, we base ourselves on the methodologies developed
in this chapter, and propose a structural approach to program optimization by
safely rewriting equivalent structures in numerical programs.
