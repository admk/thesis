The next step is to use the analyses of accuracy and resource usage of
equivalent structures in MIRs to efficiently discover optimized equivalent
MIRs.  We start by providing an overview of how the accuracy of simple
arithmetic expressions are analyzed with the \soap{} framework, and since it
only allows arithmetic expressions with simple operators $\{+, -, \times\}$, we
explain how it can be extend fully to analyze MIRs and semantic expressions.
Then this section is followed by a detailed explanation of how resources
in MIRs can be shared and how to analyze the resource utilization of MIRs.
Finally, equivalent relations are defined for the discovery of equivalent
structures, and we guide this process efficiently with our analyses of accuracy
and resource usage.
