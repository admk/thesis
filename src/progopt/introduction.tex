\section{Introduction}
\label{po:sec:introduction}

Our previous chapter introduced a new methodology to efficiently restructure
arithmetic expressions for the optimized trade-off between two performance
metrics, \ie~numerical accuracy when evaluated and area usage in synthesized
FPGA implementations.  However, this method has a substantial limitation when
applied to general numerical programs, that is, it can only be applied to
straight-line codes without control structures such as branches and loops.

The structural optimization of general numerical programs is much more complex
than that of arithmetic expressions.  The reasons are two-fold.  First,
during program execution, variables are often updated with new values.  Our
optimization should therefore perform static analysis on the values of
variables, and use the result to optimize specifically for the trade-off
between accuracy and resource usage.  Second, it is much more difficult to
formally define program equivalence, and subsequently, to search efficiently
for optimized equivalent programs.  For instance, even without the introduction
of branches and loops, the following two programs are equivalent, but
syntactically, they are very different.  In practice, it is desirable to
eliminate as much as possible the need for these syntactic rewrites that do not
affect our performance metrics.

            \texttt{x = x + 3;}
        }
    } \qquad \qquad

            \texttt{y = y * 2;} \\
            \texttt{x = x + 3;}
        }
    }

\end{figure}

Therefore, in this chapter, we provide answers to these two above issues.  In
the meantime, we propose a new general \emph{program} optimization technique
for numerical algorithms, which allows \texttt{if} statements as well as
\texttt{while} loops, and developed its accompanied tool, \newsoap, to enable
the joint optimization of accuracy and resource usage, as well as the trade-off
between these performance metrics.  We develop a tool, which we call \newsoap,
to perform source-to-source optimization of numerical programs targeting FPGAs,
and generate implementations that trade off resource usage and numerical
accuracy.

% floating-point arithmetic has round-off errors, exploit equivalence

Similar to the approach we have proposed in Chapter~\ref{chp:stropt}, we
exploit equivalence rules such as such as \emph{associativity} $(a + b) +
c \equiv a + (b + c)$, and \emph{distributivity} $(a + b) \times c \equiv
a \times c + b \times c$ to automatically optimize implementations for
the optimal trade-off between resource usage, \ie~the number of LUTs and
DSP elements utilized, and accuracy when evaluated using floating-point
computations.  For example, with single precision floating-point format, our
tool found that give an input $x \in [0, 100]$ and $y \in [0, 2]$, then the
program:
\begin{lstlisting}
    if (x < 1) {
        x = (x + y) + 0.1;
    } else {
        x = x + (y + 0.1);
    }
\end{lstlisting}
is most accurate when rewritten in the following form:
\begin{lstlisting}
    if (x < 1) {
        x = (x + 0.1) + y;
    } else {
        x = x + (y + 0.1);
    }
\end{lstlisting}
On the other hand, the original program uses fewest resources when
subexpressions are shared and the \iflit~statement is eliminated:
\begin{lstlisting}
    x = x + (y + 0.1);
\end{lstlisting}

This kind of optimization generates a Pareto optimal set of implementations,
which trades off accuracy and area.  A na{\"\i}ve strategy to search for
the Pareto optimal implementations is to discover all possible equivalent
expressions.  However, this would result in combinatorial explosion and become
intractable even for very small expressions~\cite{ioualalen,mouilleron}.  To
remedy this, in Chapter~\ref{chp:stropt} we proposed a novel approach, known
as \soap, to significantly reduce the space and time complexity to produce a
subset of the Pareto frontier. \todo{I should rewrite this.}

% program transformation why?

Our program optimization flow is \emph{safe}, \emph{semantics-directed} and
\emph{flexible}. \emph{Safety} means that because we make use of formal
mathematics to optimize programs, our approach can be proved correct, in
the sense that when executed using exact real arithmetic, the transformed
version produces exactly the same output values as the original program.
\emph{Semantics-directed} transformation means that not only do we use
program syntax, but also the semantics to guide optimization and guarantee
safety properties of the optimized program.  Our technique obtains when
necessary, by analyzing the program, a bound and a round-off error bound on
each variable in every program location.  These information are then used
to guide program optimization.  By analyzing and manipulating not only the
syntax, but also the semantics of programs.  The meaning of a \emph{flexible}
program transformation is three-fold.  First, arithmetic computations can be
optimized across assignments, \iflit~statements and \whilelit~loops.  Secondly,
we automatically explore the numerical implications of partial loop unrolling
and loop splitting, which can create more opportunity for minimizing round-off
errors, hence further increases range of options in the Pareto frontier of
trade-offs.  Finally, our method naturally subsumes constant propagation,
redundant code elimination, and also branch and loop fusions.

As none of the methods in Section~\ref{bg:sec:discovering_equivalent_programs}
of Chapter~\ref{chp:background} looks at the multiple-objective optimization
of numerical programs, we are the first to propose a tool that performs a
semantics-directed and truly restructuring program transformation, which
optimizes not only arithmetic expressions, but also numerical programs, for the
trade-off between numerical accuracy and resource usage when synthesized to
FPGAs.

% Our tool fits in the familiar setting of the high-level synthesis tool flow, as a front-end that performs the source-to-source optimization of

Our main contributions in this chapter are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \vspace{-6pt}
    \item
        A new intermediate representation of the behaviour of numerical
        programs, its structure is designed to be manipulated and analyzed
        with ease.  A new framework of numerical program transformations is
        developed to enable the back and forth translation between the program
        and a new intermediate representation (IR), which preserves the
        semantics of the original program.
    \vspace{-6pt}
    \item
        Semantics-based analyses that reason about not only the resource
        utilization (number of LUTs and DSP elements), and safe ranges of
        values and errors for programs, but also potential errors such as
        overflows and non-termination.
    \vspace{-6pt}
    \item
        A new tool, \newsoap, which trades off resource usage and accuracy
        by providing a safe, semantics-directed and flexible optimization
        targeting numerical programs for high-level synthesis.

This chapter is organized as follows.  We start by defining our program syntax
in Section~\ref{po:sec:syntax_definition}.  Using the syntax definition, we
provide a detailed formal explanation of our numerical program transformation,
which consists of three stages.  Sections~\ref{po:sec:program_to_mir}
describe how how numerical programs can be translated into MIRs,
Section~\ref{po:sec:transformations} discusses how we infer bounds and
error bounds on variables and analyze resource usage estimates, and how
these analyses can be used to efficiently discover equivalent structures
in the analyzed MIR\@.  Section~\ref{po:sec:code_generation} explains how
a chosen MIR can be translated into an optimized numerical program.  Then
we present the optimization results in Section~\ref{po:sec:results} and
Section~\ref{po:sec:conclusion} concludes this chapter.
