\section{Code Generation}
\label{po:sec:code_generation}

The final stage is to translate the optimized \gls{mir} back to a program
in its original syntax.  As discussed earlier, the \gls{ma} produces an
abstraction of the program, which means there are generally many ways of
generating different programs from the same \gls{mir}\@.  For this reason,
certain heuristic optimizations are performed before or during code generation,
such as branch and loop fusion transformations explained in our resource
usage analysis to produce a unique and deterministic translation from the
\gls{mir}\@.

Our code generation is carried out in three stages.  The first stage applies
the transformations outlined in Section~\ref{po:sec:resource_usage_analysis}
to perform loop and branch fusion, and to allow sharing of expressions
across nested \glspl{mir}. After the first stage, we perform a simple
one-to-one mapping from \glspl{mir} to program code.  This process is a
breadth-first traversal of the \gls{mir}, it keeps removing nodes that
has no data flows to other nodes in the \gls{mir} and translate each
node into one statement, and repeat this process until the \gls{mir}
is empty.  The final step of our code generation, is to perform code
sinking, which moves parts of the code so that when their results are not
needed, they are not executed~\cite{llvm}.  For instance, the result of
the statement ``$\assignstmt{x}{x + 1}$'' is only used in the true-branch
of the program ``$\assignstmt{y}{x + 1} \semicolon$ $\iflit~(x < 1)$
$\thenlit~(\assignstmt{y}{y + 1})$ $\elselit~(\assignstmt{y}{x})$''.  In this
final step of code generation, we move this statement into the true-branch of
the \iflit~statement, so it may be evaluated only when needed.
