\section{Summary}
\label{po:sec:conclusion}

A new method is proposed and carried out in \soap{} that performs general
numerical program transformation for the trade-off optimization among accuracy,
and two resource related metrics, \gls{lut} and \gls{dsp} utilizations.  To
optimize a numerical program, it starts by abstracting the program into a
\gls{mir}, which we designed to extract the essence of executing the program,
and removes unnecessary informations such as temporary variables, interleaving
of non-dependent statement, \etc{} The \gls{mir} is then optimized efficiently
by discovering a wide range of equivalent trade-off implementations of the
original \gls{mir}\@.  An optimized \gls{mir} can then be chosen to be
translated into a numerical program.  By using \soap, we optimize the accuracy
of our sample applications by up to 65\% in actual program executions.
