\section{Summary}
\label{po:sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we propose a new method and develop a tool that performs general
numerical program transformation for the trade-off optimization among accuracy,
and two resource related metrics, LUT and DSP utilizations.  To optimize a
numerical program, it starts by abstracting the program into a metasemantic
intermediate representation (MIR), which we designed to extract the essence of
executing the program, and removes unnecessary informations such as temporary
variables, interleaving of non-dependent statement, and \etc.  The MIR is then
optimized efficiently by discovering a wide range of equivalent trade-off
implementations of the original MIR\@.  An optimized MIR can then be chosen to
be translated into a numerical program.  By using our tool, we optimize the
accuracy of our sample applications by up to 65\% in actual program executions.
