\chapter{Structural Optimization of Arithmetic Expressions}
\label{chp:stropt}

% \begin{abstract}
    % This paper introduces SOAP, a new tool to automatically optimize the
% structure of arithmetic expressions for FPGA implementation as part of a
% high level synthesis flow, taking into account axiomatic rules derived
% from real arithmetic, such as distributivity, associativity and others. We
% explicitly target an optimized area/accuracy trade-off, allowing arithmetic
% expressions to be automatically re-written for this purpose. For the first
% time, we bring rigorous approaches from software static analysis, specifically
% formal semantics and abstract interpretation, to bear on source-to-source
% transformation for high-level synthesis. New abstract semantics are developed
% to generate a computable subset of equivalent expressions from an original
% expression. Using formal semantics, we calculate two objectives, the accuracy
% of computation and an estimate of resource utilization in FPGA\@. The
% optimization of these objectives produces a Pareto frontier consisting of a
% set of expressions. This gives the synthesis tool the flexibility to choose
% an implementation satisfying constraints on both accuracy and resource
% usage. We thus go beyond existing literature by not only optimizing the
% precision requirements of an implementation, but changing the structure of the
% implementation itself. Using our tool to optimize the structure of a variety of
% real world and artificially generated examples in single precision, we improve
% either their accuracy or the resource utilization by up to 60\%.

\chapter{Numerical Program Optimization}
\label{chp:progopt}

% This paper introduces a new technique, and its associated open source tool to
% automatically perform source-to-source optimization of numerical programs,
% specifically targeting the trade-off between numerical accuracy and resource
% usage as a high-level synthesis flow for FPGA implementations.  We introduce
% a new intermediate representation, which we call metasemantic intermediate
% representation (MIR), to empower the abstraction and optimization of
% numerical programs.  We efficiently discover equivalent structures in
% MIRs by exploiting the rules of real arithmetic, such as associativity
% and distributivity, and rules that enable control flow restructuring, and
% produce Pareto frontiers of equivalent programs that trades off LUTs, DSPs
% and accuracy.  Additionally, we further broaden the Pareto frontier in our
% optimization flow to automatically explore the numerical implications of
% partial loop unrolling and loop splitting.  In real applications, our tool
% discovers a wide range of Pareto optimal options, and the most accurate one
% improves the accuracy of numerical programs by up to 65\%.

\chapter{Accurate and Resource Efficient Pipelining of Numerical Programs}

% Loops are pervasive in numerical programs, so state-of-the-art high-level
% synthesis (HLS) tools use pipelining to schedule them efficiently. Still, the
% run time performance of the resultant FPGA implementation is limited by data
% dependences between loop iterations. Some of these dependence constraints can
% be alleviated by rewriting the program according to arithmetic identities
% (\eg~associativity and distributivity), memory access reductions, and
% control flow optimizations (\eg~partial loop unrolling). HLS tools cannot
% safely enable such rewrites by default because they may spoil the accuracy
% of floating-point computations and increase area usage. In this paper,
% we introduce the first open-source program optimizer for automatically
% rewriting a given program to optimize latency while controlling for accuracy
% and area. Our tool reports a three-dimensional Pareto frontier that the
% programmer can use to resolve the trade-off according to their needs. When
% applied to a suite of PolyBench and Livermore Loops benchmarks, our tool has
% generated programs that enjoy up to a 12$\times$ speedup, with a simultaneous
% 7$\times$ increase in accuracy, at a cost of up to 4$\times$ more LUTs.

\chapter{Conclusion}

\chapter{(Scratch)}

We believe that it is possible to extend our tool for the multi-objective
optimization of arithmetic expressions in the following ways. First, Secondly,
it would be useful to further allow transformations of expressions while
allowing different mantissa widths in the subexpressions, this further
increases the number options in the Pareto frontier, as well as leads to more
optimized expressions. Thirdly, as an alternative for interval analysis, we
could employ more sophisticated abstract domains that capture the correlations
between variables, and produce tighter bounds for results. Finally, there
could be a lot of interest in the HLS community on how our tool can be
incorporated with Martin Langhammer's work on fused floating-point datapath
synthesis~\cite{langhammer}.

We are convinced that with the foundation and framework that we developed,
our tool can be extended in the following ways.  First, it can be trivially
extended to support additional numerical data structure such as arrays and
matrices.  Secondly, the Pareto optimization can be extended to optimize the
latencies of equivalent programs, as restructuring programs and partially
unrolling loops could have a notable impact on the ability to pipeline
program loops, especially when arrays are incorporated.  Finally, fixed point
representations, along with the interaction between our structural optimization
and multiple wordlength optimization~\cite{constantinides} could also generate
a lot of interest from the HLS community.

Currently, our tool sees a diminishing performance return when loops are deeply
unrolled, because of a memory bottleneck. We are exploring an extension to
our tool that enables it to automatically partition arrays upon hitting such
a memory bottleneck. Also, our tool currently supports only single-precision
floating-point data types; we intend to extend this to multiple-precision
types, and explore the impact on our three performance metrics: latency,
resource utilization and numerical accuracy.
