\chapter{Structural Optimization of Arithmetic Expressions}
\label{chp:stropt}

% \begin{abstract}
    % This paper introduces SOAP, a new tool to automatically optimize the
% structure of arithmetic expressions for FPGA implementation as part of a
% high level synthesis flow, taking into account axiomatic rules derived
% from real arithmetic, such as distributivity, associativity and others. We
% explicitly target an optimized area/accuracy trade-off, allowing arithmetic
% expressions to be automatically re-written for this purpose. For the first
% time, we bring rigorous approaches from software static analysis, specifically
% formal semantics and abstract interpretation, to bear on source-to-source
% transformation for high-level synthesis. New abstract semantics are developed
% to generate a computable subset of equivalent expressions from an original
% expression. Using formal semantics, we calculate two objectives, the accuracy
% of computation and an estimate of resource utilization in FPGA\@. The
% optimization of these objectives produces a Pareto frontier consisting of a
% set of expressions. This gives the synthesis tool the flexibility to choose
% an implementation satisfying constraints on both accuracy and resource
% usage. We thus go beyond existing literature by not only optimizing the
% precision requirements of an implementation, but changing the structure of the
% implementation itself. Using our tool to optimize the structure of a variety of
% real world and artificially generated examples in single precision, we improve
% either their accuracy or the resource utilization by up to 60\%.

\chapter{Future Work}

We believe that it is possible to extend our tool for the multi-objective
optimization of arithmetic expressions in the following ways. First, Secondly,
it would be useful to further allow transformations of expressions while
allowing different mantissa widths in the subexpressions, this further
increases the number options in the Pareto frontier, as well as leads to more
optimized expressions. Thirdly, as an alternative for interval analysis, we
could employ more sophisticated abstract domains that capture the correlations
between variables, and produce tighter bounds for results. Finally, there
could be a lot of interest in the HLS community on how our tool can be
incorporated with Martin Langhammer's work on fused floating-point datapath
synthesis~\cite{langhammer}.
